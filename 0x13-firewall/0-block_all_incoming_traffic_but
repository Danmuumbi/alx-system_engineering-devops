## Firewall Configuration for web-01

To fulfill the requirements of the project, I configured the Windows Firewall on web-01 to allow incoming traffic on specific TCP ports while blocking all other incoming traffic.

### Steps Taken:

1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
2. Created a rule to allow SSH traffic on port 22:
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Local Port: 22
   - Action: Allow the connection
   - Profile: Domain, Private, Public
3. Created a rule to allow HTTP traffic on port 80:
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Local Port: 80
   - Action: Allow the connection
   - Profile: Domain, Private, Public
4. Created a rule to allow HTTPS traffic on port 443:
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Local Port: 443
   - Action: Allow the connection
   - Profile: Domain, Private, Public

### Verification:

- Checked the Inbound Rules list in Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security to ensure that the rules were created and enabled.
- Tested connectivity to web-01 using SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) from another machine to verify that the specified ports are accessible.
